# ðŸ“Š Impact Score Visualization (CS5965 & SIRIUS)

This code summarizes the visualization designs of Smriti Bajaj, Emily Colladay,
and Xiaobo Qian for SIRIUS Global, a Rome-based NGO with the mission to foster a
network of innovators across the world. The visualizations created intend to
give its audience an engaging look into the organization's imapct score system,
depicted as a choropleth map.

## ðŸ—º Data Visualization Design

For our design process, we offer two different implementations of such a map,
one uisng the Google Charts API, and the other PixiJS. This offers different
versions with the same core functionality of displaying SIRIUS' code in a
geographical manner. To manage the data, we have also included Strapi as our
CMS, with which we created a login page.
